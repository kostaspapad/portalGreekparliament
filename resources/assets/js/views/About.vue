    <!-- <p>
        The source of the data is the speech transcripts that are uploaded after every conference to the official
        website of parliament.
        
        We use a text parser to extract the data from txt, doc and docx files.
        
        We match each speech speaker with a name of the popolo speaker database in order to have data about each speakers
        membership through out the years of hes duty in parliament.
        
        Errors exist in the data, the process of the extraction and matching of speaker names with the popolo database
        cannot be error prone, so if you discover any mismaches of errors please let as know.

        The page is under development all the time.
        We are a very small team of developers so new features are taking a long time to be implemented, be pasient.

        For any questions, suggestions and error reports feel free to contact us.
